"""EU AI Act gate-to-article coverage engine for high-risk systems (v0.8.0).

For high-risk AI systems under Annex III, IKI-Gov gates G0–G5 generate the
evidence required by EU AI Act Articles 9–17. The book's orientation matrix
(``tab:framework-euaiact-gates``) maps each *gate* to its primary articles; this
module inverts that to article→gates and derives each article's coverage from the
current gate readiness:

  - OPEN     — every gate associated with the article is OPEN.
  - BLOCKED  — every associated gate is BLOCKED.
  - PARTIAL  — a mix (some evidence in place, some outstanding).

The article→gate mapping below is transcribed verbatim (inverted) from the book
and verified against both editions; it is the authoritative source — do not derive.
